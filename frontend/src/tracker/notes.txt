BLOCK LAWS:

A single block of time can be assigned only ONE category!
That category may be a subcategory of others.
That block of time may subdivided into subblocks, which can each be assigned their own category.
  e.g. 2-5pm tracker-project -> 70% tracker-project 30% mathematics
But note that this supercedes the category of the original block.
If a block is partially subdivided, the leftover time remains in the original block category.
  e.g. 2-5pm tracker-project -> subblock 30% mathematics = 70% tracker-project, 30% mathematics.

BLOCK DATA:

_id: <BlockId>
creator: <UserId>
category: <CategoryId>
subblocks: [
  {
    subdivider: 'percentage' || 'block',
    division: '30%' || <Block>,
    category: <CategoryId>
  }
],
maybe, depends on if I want to have subblocks be truly indepdent blocks, or live in the containing block
superblock: <BlockId>

startInstant:
  or...
startTime:
startDate:
startTimeZone:
  or...
start: {
  time: <IsoTime>
  date: <IsoDate>
  timeZone: <???>
}
